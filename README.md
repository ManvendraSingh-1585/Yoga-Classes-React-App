Project Description-

This is a dynamic gym website that facilitates user registration by capturing essential information such as name, email, age, phone number, gender, start date, batch time, and password. Upon successful registration, users are prompted to make a secure payment of 500 for a subscription.

Upon payment confirmation, users are seamlessly directed to a personalized main dashboard where they can access and review their profile details. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to monitor personal information and subscription status.

The system incorporates an intelligent feature that checks the time elapsed between the user's start date and the current date. If this duration exceeds 30 days, the user is prompted to renew their subscription for the next month. During this renewal process, users have the flexibility to choose a new batch time, enhancing their overall experience and convenience.

This project ensures a smooth and interactive user journey, combining ease of registration, secure payment processing, and personalized dashboard functionalities. The subscription renewal feature adds a layer of user-centricity, encouraging continued engagement with the gym services.
